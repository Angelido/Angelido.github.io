# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** February 2026

This website is a personal academic page maintained by Angelo Nardone. Your privacy is important to me, and I am committed to maintaining transparency about data practices on this site.

## What I Collect (Spoiler: Almost Nothing)

### No Tracking, No Analytics, No Cookies

This website does not employ any tracking or analytics tools. Specifically:

- **No analytics platforms** (Google Analytics, Matomo, or similar services)
- **No tracking scripts** or third-party monitoring systems
- **No advertising or profiling cookies**
- **No forms that collect personal information**

I do not actively collect, store, or process any personal data from visitors to this website.

### Server Logs (Technical Data Only)

Like most websites, this site is hosted on a server that may automatically generate standard server logs for operational and security purposes. These logs may include technical information such as:

- IP address
- Browser type and version (user-agent)
- Date and time of access
- Pages visited

This information is not used for tracking or profiling purposes. Server logs are automatically deleted after a short retention period and are accessible only to the hosting provider for technical maintenance. I do not have direct access to these logs, nor do I use them for any purpose beyond ensuring the site functions correctly.

## External Links

This website contains links to external platforms and services, including GitHub, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, ORCID, and various academic publishers and repositories.

When you click on an external link, you leave this website and the privacy policy of the destination site applies. I am not responsible for the data practices of third-party websites.

## Your Rights

Since I do not collect or store personal data through this website, there is no personal information to access, modify, or delete. If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please feel free to contact me.

## Changes to This Policy

I may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in how the site operates. Any updates will be posted on this page with a revised "Last updated" date.
