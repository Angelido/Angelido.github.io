Hi, I'm Angelo — a PhD student in **Computer Science** at the University of Pisa. I hold a Bachelor's degree in **Mathematics** from UniPi, followed by a Master's degree in **Computer Science**, also at Pisa, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. I started my doctoral journey in November 2024, driven by a passion for research and a growing interest in academic teaching.

## My Research

My field is **algorithms and data structures**, with a primary focus on **lossless text compression**. By "text" I mean any string of symbols — from DNA sequences to natural language — but my interest lies in particular in the compression of **source code**.

In my work I explore classical theoretical techniques, but I am also interested in methods that integrate AI models in a deterministic fashion. My most recent work investigates in particular how **Large Language Models** (LLMs) can be incorporated into encoding pipelines — a promising and fast-evolving direction, yet one full of open challenges. Compression is the main theme of my current research, though my broader interest extends to the field of algorithms and data structures more generally.

In the past I have also worked on AI applications in **medical contexts**, an experience that broadened my perspective on what it means to do research with a concrete impact.
