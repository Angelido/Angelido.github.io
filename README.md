## 👤 About

This site serves as my digital home base: a single-page application that brings together my **academic profile**, **research interests**, **publications**, **posts**, and personal background.

The design philosophy is *minimalism with purpose* — fast to load, easy to navigate, and focused entirely on content.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5** — semantic, accessible markup  
- **CSS3** — custom styling, no frameworks  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — lightweight interactivity, zero dependencies
