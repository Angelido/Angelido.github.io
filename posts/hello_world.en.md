Welcome to my personal page!

My name is **Angelo Nardone** and I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Pisa. This is my personal academic page — a place to gather everything related to my research journey, my career, and hopefully some reflections along the way.

## What you'll find on this site

The site is organized into several sections, each with its own purpose:

- **About Me** — An overview of who I am, my interests, and my background.
- **Research** — Information about my research, publications, talks, workshops, and other projects I am or have been involved in.
- **Education & Experience** — My academic path and relevant work experiences.
- **CV** — A downloadable version of my curriculum vitae, summarizing all of the above in a compact format.
- **Posts** — The section you are in right now. More on that in a moment.

## This page: Posts

What you are reading is the very first post of this section. The idea is to use this space fairly freely: I might write about conferences or events I have attended, dive into research topics that fascinate me, or simply share experiences from my work and life as a PhD student.

I hope to keep this section updated with some regularity — it would be a great way to share with everyone a bit of what I do and think about every day.

*I hope you enjoy browsing the site! If you have any questions, curiosities, or notice something is not working, feel free to reach out — you will find all my contact details on the page.*

*See you soon!* 🙂
