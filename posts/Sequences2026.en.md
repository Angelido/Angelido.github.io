## The Workshop

Last week I had the privilege of attending [*Sequences in London 2026*](https://sites.google.com/view/sequencesworkshop/home), a two-day workshop held on **5–6 February 2026** at Bayes Business School, City, University of London. The event brought together researchers working on a wide range of topics related to symbolic sequences — from string algorithms and data structures to computational biology, from information retrieval to compression on graphs.

## My Talk

At the workshop I presented my work titled **"Lossless Compression of Source Code using LLM"**, in which I explored how Large Language Models can be leveraged for lossless compression applied to source code. During the presentation I showed how, thanks to these new pipelines, it is possible to achieve better results in compression compared to standard algorithms, despite the still non-negligible computational cost in terms of execution time.

It was an excellent opportunity to share my research with a specialized audience and receive direct feedback from experts in the field. It was also a personal milestone: it was my **first talk given abroad**!

## People, Ideas, and Research

What made Sequences in London truly special was not just the talks and topics presented, but the people. Over the two days I had the chance to get to know the scientific community working in my research field much better. Among the participants there was a great mix of PhD students and professors, all working on fascinating problems at the intersection of algorithms, strings, and information theory.

I must say that what struck me most was precisely the human dimension of the workshop: beyond the scientific value, the event was clearly designed also to bring together people who, working in the same field, had the opportunity to meet and form lasting friendships. Despite being one of the *“newcomers”*, it wasn't difficult to integrate and feel welcomed by the group — probably the aspect I appreciated most.

## London, Ten Years Later

Beyond the research, this trip gave me something else: the opportunity to **return to London** after nearly ten years away. The city is as magnificent as I remembered. London was, and remains, one of my favourite cities in Europe — and beyond — and spending a few days there reminded me exactly why.

As for the weather... well, it was London. The classic grey skies and persistent drizzle kept me company for most of my stay. But honestly, after the start of 2026 we've had in Pisa — where sunshine has been scarce — I felt almost at home. At least in London there's a good excuse. ☁️🌧️

All in all, Sequences in London was a truly important experience for me — scientifically stimulating and valuable for new connections in the field. I look forward to the next edition!
