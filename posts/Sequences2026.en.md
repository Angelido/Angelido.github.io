## The Workshop

Last week I had the privilege of attending [*Sequences in London 2026*](https://sites.google.com/view/sequencesworkshop/home), a two-day workshop held on **5–6 February 2026** at the Bayes Business School, City, University of London. The event brought together researchers working on a broad range of topics related to symbolic sequences — from string algorithms and data structures to computational biology, music information retrieval, and combinatorics on words.

## My Talk

At the workshop, I presented my work on **"Lossless Compression of Source Code using LLM"**, exploring how large language models can be leveraged to push the boundaries of lossless compression specifically in the domain of source code. It was a great opportunity to share my research with a specialised audience and to receive direct feedback from experts in the field.

This was also a milestone for me on a personal level: it was my **first talk given abroad**, and the experience exceeded every expectation I had.

## People, Ideas, and Research

What made Sequences in London truly special was not just the talks themselves, but the people. Over the two days, I had the chance to meet a wonderful mix of fellow **PhD students** and **professors**, all working on fascinating problems at the intersection of algorithms, strings, and information theory.

Listening to my colleagues' presentations opened my eyes to several research directions I had not previously explored in depth. More importantly, through informal conversations — over coffee, lunch, and after-sessions chats — I gathered a number of **new ideas** directly relevant to my own research. The kind of spontaneous, cross-pollinating exchange that only happens when you put curious researchers in the same room is something I deeply value, and this workshop delivered it in abundance.

## London, Ten Years Later

Beyond the research, this trip gave me something else: a chance to **return to London** after nearly ten years away.

The city was as magnificent as I remembered. London remains one of my favourite cities in Europe — and not just in Europe — and spending a few days there reminded me exactly why. The energy, the architecture, the cultural richness all blending seamlessly on every street corner.

As for the weather... well, it was London. The classic grey skies and persistent drizzle were faithful companions for most of my stay. But honestly, after the relentlessly rainy start to 2026 we have had back in Pisa, I felt right at home. At least in London there is a good excuse for it. ☁️🌧️

All in all, Sequences in London was a genuinely enriching experience — scientifically stimulating, humanly rewarding, and a reminder of how much there is still to discover, both in research and in the world. I look forward to the next edition!
